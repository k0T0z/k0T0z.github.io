                            Steam Workshop SDK/Third Party Integration For ENIGMA
                        </a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I decided to use the simplest Linux distro, which is Ubuntu Linux. Using VMware Workstation, I
                        am good to go.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I tried to run the example game that contains the call to <code>SteamUser()->GetSteamID()</code>
                        and it worked! That's not what I expected but I will take it. I think it worked because
                        Steam.exe is compiled also using MinGW on Linux, it is not like Windows where it is compiled
                        using MSVC. Anyway, let's move on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now let's implement the rest of the General API and start with the Overlay API. I am really off
                        schedule, and I need to catch up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On Linux, the overlay need a special setup in order to work. This explained here in the
                        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application/platforms/linux#FAQ">FAQ</a>. When
                        I started implementing the Overlay API, I found that there is a function called
                        <code>steam_is_overlay_activated();</code> that requires using Callbacks. I don't understand how
                        Callbacks work with Steamworks, but I start with the official example game and see how they
                        implemented it. I started looking at the official documentation, and the official example game
                        at the same time. I realized that there are no Callbacks implemented in the official example
                        game for the Steam Overlay. Let's add it and see what happens. I added the code inside
                        <code>OverlayExamples.cpp</code> file as they did in other Callbacks. I ran the Spacewar game,
                        and when I press SHIFT+TAB, the overlay is activated, and a message popped up saying "yaaay",
                        and when I close it, another message popped up saying "nooo". I also tried to remove the call to
                        <code>SteamAPI_RunCallbacks();</code> function inside <code>SpaceWarClient.cpp</code> file to
                        see when will happen, and the messages are not popped up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So after these experiments, I think I need to call <code>SteamAPI_RunCallbacks();</code> on
                        a regular basis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now I think I understand how Callbacks work. But in order to implement Callbacks in my project,
                        I need to change the whole plan. I don't need to create a Wrapper in my project, I need to
                        create a layer between Steamworks ENIGMA's extension and the official Steamworks SDK. This layer
                        is some sort of architecture of classes, like composition for example. I looked at the Spacewar
                        example game, and it has all I need. Let's modify the code I wrote so far and make it work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I made some progress regarding the example game:

                        On 27 June 2023, I stopped working on the project due to Eid Al-Adha and Arafah Day. It wasn't
                        my best Eid, but I hope it will be better next year. I will continue working on the project on 2
                        July 2023.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On 2 July 2023, I started working on the project again. I finished implementing the Overlay API
                        and moved on to the Achievements API. The example game is looking greater and greater. Instead
                        of writing the Achievements API, I think this is a perfect time for writing tests for the
                        implemented APIs till now. In order to do that, I need to keep Steam running, which also means
                        that anyone who wants to run the tests needs to have Steam running. This is not good as the CI
                        doesn't have Steam installed. Also, not all ENIGMA's developers have Steam installed. So, I need
                        to write some sort of mock. I asked my mentor about this and he replied
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>
                            go ahead and write the test anyway and have the CI skip it for now
                        </p>

                        <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gamedevtv-jam-2023">Game Jam 2023</a> which I mentioned earlier? I
                        gained another 2 courses in it:

                    <p>
                        I expected that I will get some benefits from the unity multiplayer course, but it's using
                        Mirror library for networking not Steamworks.

                        On 5 July 2023, I received personal bad news that I don't want to talk about it. Now I don't
                        have any intention to work on testing and documenting. I continued working on the Stats and
                        Achievements API.
