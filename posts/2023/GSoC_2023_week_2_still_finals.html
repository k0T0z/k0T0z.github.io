                        This blog post is related to my Google Summer of Code 2023 project:
                        <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/projects/kHDskccO">
                            Steam Workshop SDK/Third Party Integration For ENIGMA
                        </a>.

                        Finally, <a href="https://www.gamedev.tv">GameDev.tv</a>'s
                        <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gamedevtv-jam-2023">Game Jam 2023</a> is over and as GameDev.tv
                        promised, any submission will get a free course from their list. I submitted 4 simple games to
                        the competition and got 3 free courses. I picked:
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse"> Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer: Learn
                                C++ & Make Video Games</a>.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealmultiplayer"> Unreal C++ Multiplayer Master:
                                Intermediate Game Development</a>.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/cpp-fundamentals"> C++ Fundamentals: Game Programming
                                For Beginners</a>.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In section 3, in the
                        <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealmultiplayer">
                            Unreal C++ Multiplayer Master: Intermediate Game Development
                        </a> course, I will learn how to
                        integrate Steamworks API to create a multiplayer game. I actually didn't watch the whole section
                        due to my finals, but I will watch it after my finals, then I will answer the question
                        <code>how?</code> in a future blog post.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I started implemented the
                        <a href="https://github.com/YoYoGames/GMEXT-Steamworks/wiki/Overlay">Overlay API</a>, check my
                        Midterm Evaluation PR <a href="https://github.com/enigma-dev/enigma-dev/pull/2343">#2343</a>,
                        and I actually finished some of the
                        <a href="https://github.com/YoYoGames/GMEXT-Steamworks/wiki/General">General API</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I continued writing the example game. I just created the starter <code>Rooms</code> and
                        <code>Objects</code>, and it is working as expected actually. There are still some unimplemented
                        functions but I am working on it and this is how it looks for now:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <img class="image-content"
                            src="assets/GSoC-2023-week-2-still-finals/ENIGMA-steamworks-main-screen-initial-look.jpg"
                            alt="ENIGMA Steamworks main screen initial look" />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        and this is the final output I wish to reach:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <img class="image-content"
                            src="assets/GSoC-2023-week-2-still-finals/GMS-steamworks-main-screen-final-look.jpg"
                            alt="GMS Steamworks main screen final look" />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Due to my finals, I didn't do much this week.
