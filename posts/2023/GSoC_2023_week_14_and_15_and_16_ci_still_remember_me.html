                        Social API needs the buffer work from previous GSoC 2022 project.
                        <a href="https://github.com/enigma-dev/enigma-dev/pull/2361">#2361</a> provides the
                        buffer work. We need to merge it to our branch and then start working on it. The code
                        in this PR is based on <code>AST-Generation</code> branch, which is a branch that
                        contains the total rewrite for the parser, which also means that it is a very
                        dangerous branch to work on. So I decided to move on to the next phase which is the
                        testing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The problem with testing is it will only pass locally on my machine because I have
                        Steam.exe installed. For the CI, it doesn't have access to Steam which means that
                        all tests are going to fail.

                        </a> solves my problem. I need to mock the API calls somehow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I started mocking every every function that I used from Steam API. This was the easy
                        part. Now if I want to link using the Mock API I specify this:
                    <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="c++">
    SOURCES += $(wildcard Universal_System/Extensions/Steamworks/gameclient/SteamMock/sdk/public/steam/*.cpp)
    override CXXFLAGS += -I$(ENIGMA_ROOT)/ENIGMAsystem/SHELL/Universal_System/Extensions/Steamworks/gameclient/SteamMock/sdk/public/
                        </code></pre>
                    </figure>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And if I want the real API I specify this:
                    <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="c++">
    override CXXFLAGS += -I$(ENIGMA_ROOT)/ENIGMAsystem/SHELL/Universal_System/Extensions/Steamworks/gameclient/Steamv157/sdk/public/
    override LDFLAGS += -L$(ENIGMA_ROOT)/ENIGMAsystem/SHELL/Universal_System/Extensions/Steamworks/gameclient/Steamv157/sdk/redistributable_bin/linux64
    override LDLIBS += -lsteam_api
                        </code></pre>
                    </figure>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note that the above code is applicable for Linux only.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Notice the problem? The CI won't do it this way. I need to find a way that
                        automates it somehow. A way that I don't need to comment and uncomment codes
                        everytime. I asked fundies about it:
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>
                            you need to make a STEAM_SDk_PATH or similar variable for one
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            you can make enviornmental variable that can be overriden at compile time
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <a
                                href="https://github.com/enigma-dev/enigma-dev/blob/master/ENIGMAsystem/SHELL/Makefile#L28"></a>
                            sets a variable in make if its not defined
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            you make need to do something i dont remember for make to take in enviormental variable
                            prepended to an emake run or lgm startup
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            but it should be like STEAM_SDK_PATH=/a/path ./emake .....
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            if you can get that working you need to plumb it into test harness execute command
                        </p>

                            Automate mock generation? Or inject a mock under certain circumstances?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We have TestValues for that, but in general, the mock follows the same interface, so you can
                            use any old global

                        I had a very long conversation about that with fundies:

                            I might’ve just made the mock steam a dll and changed which it loads at runtime using
                            LD_LIBRARY_PATH

                        <p>
                            What im unsure about is if you can build the game without linking the dll and just load it a
                            runtime or if you can always link the mock dll and load the real one at runtime
                        </p>

                            but it will always find the mock to link

                        <p>
                            The game should look for the dll at load time
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the ci you need to tell its where ever you built the mock dll

                        <p>
                            Using ldlibrarypath before launching the game probably
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What i need you to figure out is how to make it so it only matters what dll is available at
                            runtime
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Compile time it just needs to be aware that something provides steam funcs
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Afaik as long as the two dlls are abi compatible you should be able to swap them at will but
                            I haven’t done this in practice

                    <p>
                        So what I need to do now is to finish the Social API ASAP becuase we much work for the
                        deployment. When I merged the <code>AST-Generation</code> branch to mine and started working on
                        it, the new parser didn't like my demo game. I think the new parser hates the old parser
                        &#129315;. Anyway let's modify the demo game so that our new parser likes it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You know what? I think I am gonna use only that branch for implementing my functions. That's
                        becuase GMS wrote the demo game as I wrote.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I implemented a simple demo game that runs very well with the new parser under the
                        <code>AST-Generation</code> branch. When switching between <code>master</code> and
                        <code>AST-Generation</code>, I have to run make which takes a noticeable time. I managed to
                        implement most of the functions but specifically, <code>steam_image_get_rgba();</code> returns
                        RGBA data in a buffer. Dhruv mentioned that ENIGMA expects ARGB. See the picture below:

                    <p>
                        Now I will leave the rest of the work after the deployment is done. Before working on the Fake
                        API, I need to solve the Stub extensions problem. There are two places I need to inject to
                        Testharness command. The first one is the stubs' location. The second one is the mock location.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The easy one was the stubs' location. However, there are some tests that are not passing
                        but I think they are not related to the stubs. Here is new structure:
                    <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="c++">
    enigma-dev
    ├── ...
    └── ENIGMAsystem
        └── SHELL
            ├── Makefile   <--------- Main Makefile
            ├── ...
            └── Universal_System
                ├── ...
                └── StubExtensions
                    ├── ...
                    └── Steamworks
                        ├── About.ey
                        ├── Makefile
                        └── stubs.cpp
                        </code></pre>
                    </figure>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is was simple as adding a condition in the main Makefile to enable the stub if
                        the real extension is not enabled.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The fake API nearly implemented but it has a memory leak I need to fix later. The fake API was
                        some source files for the original API headers. As fundies suggested, I will build those sources
                        as a DLL and then load it dynamically if the real API is not available. This way the CI problem
                        will be solved.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the fake API is implmeneted and tested, there is no major work left. All the upcoming work
                        is considered as flushing, cleaning, and improving the Steamworks extension.
