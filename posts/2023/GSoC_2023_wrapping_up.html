                    <p>
                        Overall, I think I did quite well, I learned a lot of interesting things. Maybe, the tricky
                        part in this project was the deployment of the extension. Although the extension is ready for
                        production usage, it only supports Ubuntu Linux for now. This is because ENIGMA is broken on
                        MacOS and semi-broken on Windows at the time of writing this post.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I missed only one goal, which is the <code>Cloud</code> API. In my proposal, I saved enough
                        time for development and documentation, but didn't save enough time for testing and deployment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The problem with my approach is that, the CI pipeline will fail. That's because I am calling
                        Steamworks API functions directly from the extension, and the CI pipeline doesn't have the
                        Steamworks SDK installed. Moreover, the tests will depend on other factors such as the internet
                        connection. The API call may fail for any reason which means that the test will fail. Which also
                        means that the CI pipeline have for example 50% chance of failing or even more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Of course, a CI that has a probability of failing is not a good CI. To overcome this problem, I
                        will need to mock the API calls. That was actually fundies' idea. At this moment, I will drop
                        the Cloud API milestone and focus on refactoring the whole code. There was two difficulties in
                        this approach:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Mocking the Steamworks SDK is not that easy. Steam has a weird way of doing specific things
                            using macros.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I will need to refactor the whole code, which is not that easy.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I skipped refactoring the code by creating another layer between the game_client and Steamworks
                        SDK. This layer will be responsible for binding every function inside the Steamworks SDK to
                        the user functions inside Steamworks extension.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mocking the Steamworks SDK is done, you can view it here:
                        <a
                            href="https://github.com/enigma-dev/enigma-dev/tree/master/ENIGMAsystem/SHELL/Universal_System/Extensions/Steamworks/gameclient/steambinder/SteamFake/sdk">
                            Universal_System/Extensions/Steamworks/gameclient/steambinder/SteamFake/sdk
                        </a>. The concept is simple, but code style is not beginner-friendly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another thing related to the deployment is the stub extensions:
                        <a
                            href="https://github.com/enigma-dev/enigma-dev/tree/master/ENIGMAsystem/SHELL/Universal_System/StubExtensions">
                            Universal_System/StubExtensions
                        </a>. After I used some user functions inside the engine code itself, the CI failed because the
                        extensions from which these functions are defined are not enabled.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think I have talked about all CI problems in this post:
                        <a
                            href="https://k0t0z.github.io/posts/2023/GSoC_2023_week_14_and_15_and_16_ci_still_remember_me.html">

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have to mention that also <code>Social</code> API is not fully implemented. I have explained
                        why in my final report:
                        <a href="https://k0t0z.github.io/posts/2023/GSoC_2023_final_evaluation_report.html">
                            Google Summer of Code 2023 Final Evaluation Report
                        </a>. It worth noting that this PR
                        <a href="https://github.com/enigma-dev/enigma-dev/pull/2361">#2361</a> will solve many problems
                        including the <code>Social</code> API. Also, I have to mention that the demo game doesn't work
                        under the <code>AST-Generation</code> branch due to the big changes to the compiler (JDI) so I
                        had to implement a specific version of the demo game for this branch which is not included in
                        the PR but you can get it from my blog:
                        <a
                            href="https://k0t0z.github.io/posts/2023/assets/GSoC_2023_wrapping_up/steamworks-demo-special.zip">
                            steamworks-demo-special.zip
                        </a>. To run this project, just run: <code>git pull upstream AST-Generation</code> and of course
                        your upstream is: <code>https://github.com/enigma-dev/enigma-dev</code>. This is to get the
                        latest changes from the <code>AST-Generation</code> branch into your clone. If you don't have
                        the upstream set, you can run:
                        <code>git remote add upstream https://github.com/enigma-dev/enigma-dev</code>. Then switch to
                        <code>AST-Generation</code> branch by running: <code>git switch AST-Generation</code>. Then
                        run: <code>git merge master</code>. You will have some conflicts, go and fix them by accepting
                        the changes from the <code>AST-Generation</code> branch. Now it is time for builing LGM but
                        before that, you need to clean the previous build by running: <code>make clean</code>. Then
                        run: <code>make</code>. This will take a long time. After that, you can run LGM by running:
                        <code>java -jar lateralgm.jar</code>. Now open the demo game project and enable the Steamworks
                        and Json extensions from LGM. Hit the run button. You should see your steam picture in the game
                        window.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Maybe, I will record a video for how to setup Steamworks extension and how to test it and upload
                        it to my YouTube channel in the future ISA.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Due to the deployment issue, I didn't have enough time to provide a proper test cases for the
                        extension.
                    </p>
                    <P>
                        I documented every user function very well actually and I still need to move all that to the
                        <a href="https://enigma-dev.org/docs/Wiki/Category:Function:ENIGMA">wiki</a>. I think I will do
                        it outside Google Summer of Code 2023 program.
                    </P>
                    <p>
                        There is also some modifications to the extension's demo game due to Copyrights stuff.

                        I wanna also mention my mistakes in my proposal. I have mentioned that and I quote: "This idea
                        is about creating a C++ wrapper for Steamworks API – which is developed and maintained by Valve
                        corporation – so ENIGMA can use it." Well, wrappers are meant to port Steam SDK from C++ to
                        another programming language such as C# or Java. This is to make it more easier to integrate
                        Steamworks API with other programming languages. Some of these wrappers are mentioned on the
                        Steamworks website: <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk/api">doc/sdk/api</a> (See
                        <code>Commercial engine and non-C++ language support</code> section). The thing is this project
                        is not to create a wrapper, but to intergate Steamworks API with ENIGMA game engine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another thing in my proposal is that, the <code>Authentication and Ownership</code> API isn't
                        related to this part of the project. It was one of the primary goals of the project, but I
                        figured out later, it should be moved to the 2nd phase of this project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The final problem in my proposal is that I didn't figure out how should I use the Steam console
                        for testing. Is it for testing the SDK development or can be used for testing the integration
                        with other game engines?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have to say it, I loved the lighting talks this year and also the Insulated Travel Tumbler
                        gift from Google Open-source.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So this wraps up my GSoC project and this series of logs. If anyone was following it by any
                        chance, huge thank to you. Have a nice year ahead!
