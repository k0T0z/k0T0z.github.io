                        My acceptance story is not fun as my rejection story, because I have much experience with
                        ENIGMA's codebase now which means my questions are more technical than general. The Steam
                        project was <a href="https://github.com/RobertBColton">Robert</a>'s idea

                    <p>
                        After long thought, I decided to work on the Steam Integration project. That was an interesting
                        project by the way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I started by looking at the official
                        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/home">Steamworks documentation</a>. Actually, it
                        took me a while to understand how Valve wrote its documentation. I noticed the example game they
                        provided for developers in order to understand more about the Steamworks API. I downloaded the
                        game and started to play with it. Although I've got some errors, I managed to fix them
                        immediately. I started to read the code and understand how it works. The code was split into two
                        parts, the first part is the engine itself with some shading and rendering code. The second part
                        is the APIs. I decided to start running a standalone program. I used CMake build system to link
                        Steamworks library to my executable. It worked without any problem, so I started to write my
                        proposal at this moment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Something really happened that I didn't give much attention to. I was using MinGW GCC compiler
                        to build and run, and it worked fine. When I tried to get the current Steam ID
                        <code>SteamUser()->GetSteamID()</code> of currently logged-in user, I got nothing in VSCode
                        terminal. I thought that there must be something wrong with my code, so I ignored it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Later on, while I am working on the project, I noticed that the same function and the same
                        problem. Can you guess what was the problem?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I decided to write the starter code for the Steamworks extension. For ENIGMA, there are a bunch
                        of files that must be added in order for the extension to work correctly. <code>About.ey</code>,
                        which contains name and description of the extension. <code>Makefile</code>, which contains the
                        required codes for linking the extension to the executable. <code>include.h</code>, which
                        contains the header files for the extension. My mentors: fundies and rpjohnst helped me a lot
                        with it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I decided to start linking Steamworks library to ENIGMA instead of writing a standalone program.
                        I started to read about Makefile files and how to link libraries to ENIGMA. Actually, working on
                        ENIGMA's build system was very beneficial for me.

                            right, but finding headers and finding libs are two different things that use different

                        That's my first progress in the Steam API integration project &#x1F64C;. I managed to link the
                        Steamworks library to ENIGMA. The Steamworks Overlay can now be accessed from my empty project
                        by pressing Shift + Tab.

                        Remember Dhruv and Kartik? They were applying for GSoC '22 with me. Remember when I said they
                        helped me a lot? Well, they helped me a lot in GSoC '23 too. Dhruv helped me with the proposal,
                        he also gave me his credentials for GMS as I couldn't sign up due to something with YOYO Games
                        server. Kartik reviewed my proposal like 100 times, I really can't forget their help so I
                        decided to mention them here.

                        On 04/05/2023, I received the acceptance email from Google. Actually, what makes this special is
                        that as claimed by Stephanie Taylor:
