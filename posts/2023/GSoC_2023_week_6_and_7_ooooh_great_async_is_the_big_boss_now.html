                        When the <code>Stats and Achievements</code> API is done, I continued to work on the
                        <code>Leaderboard</code> API. I started learning about <code>CallResults</code> because I am
                        going to use it in the <code>Leaderboard</code> API.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Actually, learning about <code>CallResults</code> was not that hard as I know how to
                        use <code>Callbacks</code> which has a similar concept.

                        The real problem that I faced is with ENIGMA's <code>Async</code> system. The
                        <code>Async</code> system will need some modifications as it is not Thread safe which
                        means that I can't depend on it. The
                        <a
                            href="https://github.com/enigma-dev/enigma-dev/tree/master/ENIGMAsystem/SHELL/Universal_System/Extensions/Asynchronous">
                            Universal_System/Extensions/Asynchronous
                        </a> extension is the one we are talking about here. As Robert said, this extension
                        will need some work as it's not thread safe. I will have to create an issue for that
                        to be fixed later.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <code>Async</code> system is used to send and store data inside a user variable
                        called <code>async_load</code>. The game developer can then read that variable and
                        get the value for each key inside it using the <code>DataStructures</code> extension.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I will leave the testing for later. Creating SOGs and make the CI handles them
                        is tricky because we need <code>Steam.exe</code> to be running in the background.

                            we can switch (event_name) and make your queue processing fire more events

                        I had a long discussion with Josh about Robert's requested changes to the
                        <code>Async</code> System and Josh suggested to use the old system for some
                        reason:
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>
                            I think I'm gonna need to chat about this with him, first
                        </p>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Actually, after this discussion, I learned about the code generation system that
                        ENIGMA uses:
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>
                            it has to be the bottommost one, ObjectLocals
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            however, that would mean that you need to build any routine that's calling the
                            event against the generated ObjectLocals sources
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            if you check your codegen folder, you should see an entry by that name in ObjectLocals
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ~/.enigma
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            or on Windows, {APP_DATA}/.enigma
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            specifically,
                            <code>~/.enigma/Preprocessor_Environment_Editable/IDE_EDIT_objectdeclarations.h</code>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            to give a little better detail before I pass out, the reason we have those extension cast
                            routines
                            is so that we don't need to know about object_locals in the extension source code
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            otherwise, we'd have to rebuild every extension every time the game changed
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            no, it's just the name of the bottommost parent class
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            it's generated code
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            iiuc, if you open that header file, you should see myevent_steam declared in struct
                            object_locals
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            if you instead go the extension route, you can declare your own event by that name and use
                            the
                            generated cast routine from a separate source
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            so uncomment the stuff you showed me earlier, but rename the event to match what's in
                            events.ey
                        </p>

                    <p>
                        Bascially, this queue will contain any event from any extension we have, which means we
                        might face Race Condition problems. That's why I need to protect the queue from reading
                        and writing at the same time. Actually, ENIGMA is single threaded so I will wait for
                        confirmation from Robert that this is not needed.

                        This is how the new Async system works now and the problem is with oraganizing the code.

                            probably make the layer class core/universal system or something like add a way to register
                            event types in an extension by string name with pointer function that the process queue uses

                        regarding Steam <code>Callbacks</code>. The problem is ENIGMA is single threaded and we don't
                        know if Steam <code>Callbacks</code> are using threads or not.
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>
                            normally nothing in ENIGMA is threaded, so it doesn't matter when we check for things
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            but in this case, some 3-p API is using threads, and we want to adapt that to our
                            single-thread system
                        </p>

                            i.e, the only way the API gives us to know that something has happened is to give it a
                            routine to run in a background thread

                        So the problem is basically without using <code>Callbacks</code>, I need to handle the State
                        Management code myself and the reason I said possible above is that I don't know if that's
                        possible with Steamworks API or not. I told Robert that it's not a good time for that change but
                        I will add it as a TODO for later.

                        <li>Implement the rest APIs.</li>
                        <li>Creating SOGs and trying to make it work as I mentioned earlier that it's tricky because we
                            need Steam to be running in order the tests to pass.
                        </li>
                        <li>Cleaning up and organizing the new Async System to match Robert's needs.</li>
                        <li>Checking if <code>Callbacks</code> uses Threads. If so then try to handle the State
                            Management manually.</li>

                        I will just leave the following conversation here for reference:
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>
                            callbacks are very important because for example when the user opens the Overlay i can set a
                            variable to true but what happens when close it, i don't call a function to close the
                            overlay the user can close it from the X button at the top right so no way i can know if
                            it's closed or not that's why callbacks are very important, any event happens like closing
                            or opening the overlay the callback function is called and i know the event type as well,
                            how im gonna build that behavior without callbacks idk

                        <p>
                            just like how modern OpenGL and Vulkan don't give you ANY state management, you have to do
                            it yourself

                            ok, well those older GL apis are deprecated
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            because they required a stack to implement, aka state management

                        <p>
                            all the Graphics APIs, D3D, GL, Vulkan (it started with AMD Mantle and Apple Metal) moved to
                            being low-level
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            that dropped everything but triangle primitives (no quads, fans etc) and all the upper-level
                            state management and provided only programmable graphics shaders
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            so basically people/game engines have had to reimplement state machines on top of that

                        <p>
                            @Saif and i am using that as an analogy for why the steam callbacks are "wrong"
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            they are low-level, which is very efficient, but they are NOT providing that state
                            management for us (we don't know, that was Josh's question!), but we end up having to write
                            a queue and do synchronization ourselves

                            @Saif the latter is like how we do input in XInput extension for Xbox 360 controller,
                            extension polls the state of the controller 1-time every single frame, caches that, and all
                            the functions are just returning state from that cached value, ideally if Steam had an API
                            to do that for leaderboards it would be great and that's what Josh was questioning if
                            existed
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            again idk if Steam supports that way of doing it or not, but feel free to look into the docs
                            and let us know
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            the reason Josh favors that way is because, albeit it looks slightly more verbose than the
                            other way, but it's not when you consider the other way required us to add a queue and
                            synchronization primitive which are exactly the things Josh feels "wrong" about muddying up
                            our main loop with
                        </p>

                        So the new Async system basically is for me to work using Thread safe code

                            right, and agreed, for now we just want Saif's to work and be thread safe

                        This is my last day before the midterms evaluation so I will just focus on cleaning up
                        <code>Leaderboard</code> API and document all the implemented APIs.

                        My POE ChatGPT account is now become paid. The POE was just starting out so when they became
                        stable, they started to charge for their services. I tried to find a way to register but
                        couldn't. My father helped me alot with that as his cousin lives in Poland. He gave me his
                        number to register an account with it. It was very easy that way. Actually, if he knew what
                        I did to activate my account... I don't even want to think about it. Anyway, enough with the
                        drama, let's get ready for Midterm Evaluations.
