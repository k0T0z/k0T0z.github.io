                        After 1 year of waiting, I have finally been selected for GSoC 2023! I really can't wait to work
                        with my mentors <a href="https://github.com/RobertBColton">Robert</a>,
                        <a href="https://github.com/JoshDreamland">Josh</a>,
                        <a href="https://github.com/rpjohnst">rpjohnst</a>, and
                        <a href="https://github.com/hpgDesigns">Hugar</a> this summer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I decided to work on issue
                        <a href="https://github.com/enigma-dev/enigma-dev/issues/1881">#1881</a>
                        (<code>Steam Workshop SDK/Third Party Integration</code>) idea for GSoC 2023. The idea is to
                        implement a wrapper around the Steamworks API, and then implement User functions' APIs for
                        ENIGMA game engine. Game developers can then use these functions (AKA scripts) to integrate
                        their games with Steamworks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I figured out that creating the wrapper itself isn't the project. ENIGMA is used for creating
                        games by writing EDL scripts, it's not like Unreal Engine for example, as it uses C++ mainly for
                        creating games, but for ENIGMA, we will create the wrapper itself and then write the necessary
                        user functions for different APIs mentioned in my proposal. This is not enough, ENIGMA uses EDL
                        for creating games but it's written in C++ so why create a wrapper in the first place? Steam SDK
                        is also written in C++ so I can directly go ahead and write the user functions. "I think it'd be
                        better if you did that and did not use the abstraction" Robert replied.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before getting started, I must familiarize myself with ENIGMA's extension system as it is the
                        basis of this project. I wrote a Makefile file (thanks to rpjohnst) to link the Steam lib with
                        the executable. Here's the main structure:
                    <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="c++">
    override CXXFLAGS += -I$(ENIGMA_ROOT)/ENIGMAsystem/SHELL/Universal_System/Extensions/Steamworks/gameclient/steambinder/Steamv157/sdk/public/
                    
    ifeq ($(TARGET-PLATFORM), Windows)

        override LDFLAGS += -L$(ENIGMA_ROOT)/ENIGMAsystem/SHELL/Universal_System/Extensions/Steamworks/gameclient/steambinder/Steamv157/sdk/redistributable_bin/win64/
        override LDLIBS += -lsteam_api64
    
    else ifeq ($(TARGET-PLATFORM), Linux)
    
        override LDFLAGS += -L$(ENIGMA_ROOT)/ENIGMAsystem/SHELL/Universal_System/Extensions/Steamworks/gameclient/steambinder/Steamv157/sdk/redistributable_bin/linux64
        override LDLIBS += -lsteam_api
    
    endif
                            </code></pre>
                    </figure>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This file is written before getting accepted into the program, I will be using it through the
                        summer, and will be modified if needed.

                        </a> is a very good resource for this.

                        As I mentioned in my proposal that I will start by creating the example game that will showcase
                        the extension capabilities. I won't anything creative, I will just try to use GMS's style. I
                        am not a GUI designer anyway.
