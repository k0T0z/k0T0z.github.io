                        Although I faced some problems because I am very bad at game development, everything is going
                        well so far. My mentor <a href="https://github.com/hpgDesigns">Hugar</a> really helped me a lot.

                        Before getting accepted to GSoC, my mentor Robert talked with me about something that I might
                        face while working called ABI Compatibility Issues and he linked these resources:
                        <a
                            href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/xl-c-and-cpp-aix/16.1?topic=migration-compatibility-considerations-when-mixing-object-files">
                            Compatibility considerations when mixing object files, IBM
                        </a>, and
                        <a
                            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/yn0xsf/comment/iv6l3wx/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3">
                            How is code created by different compilers able to be linked together, such as when using
                            libraries?, Reddit
                        </a>. I have explained it in my
                        <a href="assets/steam-workshop-SDK-third-party-integration-for-ENIGMA-GSoC-2023-proposal.pdf">
                            Steam Workshop SDK/Third Party Integration For ENIGMA
                        </a> proposal so check it out if you are interested. The thing is I tested only a prototype of
                        my project, I didn't dig deep into it, which by definition doesn't cause any ABI Compatibility
                        Issues. I mentioned also that I don't expect any ABI Compatibility Issues to happen, but I was
                        wrong. I was very confident because I tested it even with advanced C++ Classes and it worked
                        fine just as rpjohnst said.

                        Remember the function I was testing before I got accepted into GSoC? The
                        <code>SteamUser()->GetSteamID()</code>? Well, this function won't work with ENIGMA. ENIGMA is
                        compiled with MinGW, and Steamworks SDK is compiled with MSVC. Of course, there are some
                        functions that will work fine, but this one fails. I need MSVC support for ENIGMA, in order to
                        work with Steamworks SDK without any problems. Back then, I wasn't aware of this issue, even
                        now, I debugged my code and nothing wrong with it.

                        Only Segmentation fault not very helpful. I tried to look at other wrappers, the documentation,
                        ChatGPT, and even searched online, and I found nothing. I thought at first that this issue is
                        due to Steamworks API, but if that is the case then why the official example
                        (<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk/api/example">SpaceWar</a>) game works fine? or
                        why the GMS's example
                        (<a href="https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/assets/10709/steamworks-ext">Demo</a>) works fine as
                        well? then it's an issue due to something with ENIGMA. I asked my mentor for help and he
                        replied:

                        This is exactly what I did before the bonding period. Let's leave ENIGMA for now and use
                        <code>g++ main.cpp -o main.exe -Lredistributable_bin/win64 -lsteam_api64</code>, and nothing
                        happens, the code works fine until it reaches <code>SteamUser()->GetSteamID()</code> function,
                        then nothing happens. I tried it again but using Git Bash terminal this time, and now I saw the
                        error message. I don't know why it didn't show up in VSCode terminal, but I am glad it showed
                        up. The error message is saying <code>Segmentation fault</code>. I asked my mentor again for
                        help and he replied:

                        I tried it in MSVC and it worked fine &#x1F631;. This is not a good thing by the way, actually,
                        this is not good at all. Remember the ABI thing I mentioned earlier? well, it seems that we
                        have got an ABI problem here.

                        I asked my mentor again for help but this time it was serious. Robert told me to wait for Josh's
                        reply, and recommended installing Linux. fundies also told me to install Linux.

                        These are some solutions to this problem I gathered from mentors' conversations:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Add MSVC support for ENIGMA, but this is a project on its own.</li>
                        <li>Decompile Steamworks SDK, but this is against the terms.</li>
                        <li>We can't link to MinGW, so we will use RPC. Don't know what is this!</li>
                        <li>Use Linux instead of Windows, and I will start with this one.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
