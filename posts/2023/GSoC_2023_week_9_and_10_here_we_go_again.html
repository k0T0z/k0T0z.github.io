                        I still haven't finished the Leaderboard API, so let's talk about the next steps.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First of all, the Async system is working fine but I don't know how the
                        <code>DataStructures</code> extension works, so let us look at the code and see
                        what we can do.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Actually, the problem is not with the new Async system because I already tested it
                        before. The problem is with my new code I added. When I looked closer at the code, I
                        found that I was returning <code>std::string&</code> and assigning it to my event map.
                        Let's try to remove it and see what happens.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The code is working just fine, so let's add a TODO for studying this behavior later.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, let's understand more about how ENIGMA's Async system works. From the output
                        when firing an event it looks like this:
                    <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="c++">
    INFO: Steam ASYNC: {  }
                        </code></pre>
                    </figure>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I run the GMS official example game, the Async output is between those parenthesis.
                        My output looks like this for now:
                    <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="c++">
    INFO: Steam ASYNC: {  }
    INFO: leaderboard_download
                        </code></pre>
                    </figure>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is not inside the parenthesis, let's try to fix it. A new idea came to my mind to find out
                        where the code that prints this output in the console. I remembered my old conversation with
                        Josh, and he said that ENIGMA has a code generation system. I don't know how it works yet, but
                        this means that the code in the main repo is not the full running code. Maybe if I can get to
                        this generated code, I can find what I need so let's try that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Inside <code>~/.enigma/Preprocessor_Environment_Editable/</code> directory, I used VSCode search
                        in files feature. I love VSCode because of this one by the way. I found that there is a file
                        called <code>IDE_EDIT_objectfunctionality.h</code> that has the what I was looking for:
                    <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="c++">
    <span class="k">variant</span> enigma::OBJ_Obj_Steam::<span class="nf">myevent_steam</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="p">)</span>
    {
        enigma::temp_event_scope ENIGMA_PUSH_ITERATOR_AND_VALIDATE<span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">this</span><span class="p">)</span>;
        
        <span class="si">{</span>
        <span class="n">show_debug_message</span>(<span class="s2">"</span><span class="s2">Steam ASYNC: </span><span class="s2">"</span>+ json_encode(async_load));
        
        <span class="si">}</span>
        ;
        
        return 0;
    }
                        </code></pre>
                    </figure>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From what I see is that it uses <code>async_load</code> variable to get the output. This
                        means that there is no output inside, which means that there is a problem with the new
                        Async system I implemented. Let's look at the code again and see what we can do.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I found that it's working perfectly nothing wrong with my code but where's the string
                        inside the parenthesis? you know what, this means one thing the problem is with
                        <code>json_encode()</code> function. Ooooh my god I remembered now, I have already
                        worked on that JSON extension before getting accepted at GSoC. I have already talked
                        with fundies about this but I also remember that he didn't say anything about this
                        function being broken.

                        It look like this now:
                    <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="c++">

        Json::Value root;
        return string("{  }");
    }
                        </code></pre>
                    </figure>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's modify it now to return the data inside the <code>ds_map</code> variable.

                    <p>
                        So I provided this patch <a href="https://github.com/enigma-dev/enigma-dev/pull/2352">#2352</a>
                        to fix this issue. It still needs some tests so here's the TODO:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Implement some tests.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, thanks to Robert for merging my patch
                        <a href="https://github.com/enigma-dev/enigma-dev/pull/2335">#2335</a> which is provided to fix
                        both <a href="https://github.com/enigma-dev/enigma-dev/issues/1951">#1951</a> and
                        <a href="https://github.com/enigma-dev/enigma-dev/issues/2339">#2339</a>. There are still some
                        changes that need to be done to the patch but it's good for now.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Move to <code>std::sstream</code> instead of <code>std::string</code>.</li>
                        <li>Implement the error system.</li>
                        <li>Improve tests and makefiles that link them.</li>
                        <li>
                            The number values are not fully implemented. Check

                        Back to the Steam issue I was facing on my Ubuntu, the problem is when I run Steam, it keeps ON
                        and OFF without being opened. The solution is pretty simple by the way.
                        <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/1349490/steam-opens-and-then-just-closes">
                            askubuntu.com/questions/1349490/steam-opens-and-then-just-closes
                        </a> solves the issue and it's basically about changing the NVIDIA drivers. Just choose any
                        version other than the open-source one.
