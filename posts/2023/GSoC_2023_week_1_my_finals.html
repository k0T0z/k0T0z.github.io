                        This blog post is related to my Google Summer of Code 2023 project:

                        My finals started on 30 May 2023 and will be ended on 14 June 2023. I can't really focus on
                        two tasks at the same time, so I decided to decrease my pace in the Steam project by:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Perparing the PR <a href="https://github.com/enigma-dev/enigma-dev/pull/2343">#2343</a>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Joining the Steamworks group on Steam.
                        </li>
                        <li>Reading the Steamworks documentation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I started looking into these wrappers before I start coding
                        <a href="https://github.com/Facepunch/Facepunch.Steamworks">Facepunch.Steamworks</a> &
                        <a href="https://github.com/code-disaster/steamworks4j">steamworks4j</a>, then I started to
                        enhance the <code>General API</code> I implemented before.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I tried to join the Steamworks group on Steam, but it's for Steam partners only. I need to
                        have a game uploaded to Steam to join the group.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The example game architecture provided by Steamworks is a bit interesting. It's exactly what
                        I need in order for me to understand more about the SDK. I made some modifications to it as
                        well as a proof of concept.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Due to my finals, I didn't do much this week.
