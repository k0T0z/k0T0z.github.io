                    <p>
                        Before talking about how the evaluation works for me, let's talk about some things
                        that I leaned during the past week. First of all I for the first time understood
                        how <code>extern</code> works in c++. Let me explain a bit. When you define a variable
                        in the header file and initialize it in the source file, then try to include that header
                        file in multiple source files, you will get a linker error. This is because the linker
                        tracked multiple definitions of the same variable. To solve this problem, the definition
                        will be in the source file, and <code>extern</code> to this variable in the header file
                        like so:
                    <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="c++">
    <span class="c2">// leaderboards.cpp</span>

    unsigned lb_max_entries{10};
                            </code></pre>
                    </figure>
                    <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="c++">
    <span class="c2">// leaderboards.h</span>

    extern unsigned lb_max_entries;
                            </code></pre>
                    </figure>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another thing I learned is that compilers has unexpected behavior so you must be careful
                        especially when you are using a build system such as GNU Make. Employ macros for header
                        guards and <code>extern</code> instead of normal definitions. Actually, when working on
                        something like this, you must do it step by step. If you wrote a whole bunch of lines at
                        once, it's very likely going to fail. Even with very deep understanding of the buid system
                        and the compiler theory. That's just uncontrolled complexity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The evaluation is going great actually, and no problems at all.

                            @Saif / @Fares Atef in case this isn't clear to you, you're both getting good marks on
                            your midterm evaluations; I hope neither of you is stressing about timing

                    <p>
                        The midterm evaluation is just a couple of questions Google asks to you by using a simple
                        form such as if I were a GSoC student in 2022, or how many weeks I have been contributing
                        to my organization before applying to GSoC 2023 ...etc. I won't bother myself with it more
                        than that. I will just take some rest to take care of other stuff in my life.

                        The TODO for the next phase now became bigger and bigger:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Implement the rest APIs.</li>
                        <li>Getting an <code>AppId</code> and upload a game on Steam for testing.</li>
                        <li>Creating SOGs and trying to make it work as I mentioned earlier that it's tricky because
                            we need Steam to be running in order the tests to pass.
                        </li>
                        <li>Cleaning up and organizing the new Async System to match Robert's needs.</li>
                        <li>
                            Checking if <code>Callbacks</code> uses Threads. If so then try to handle the State
                            Management manually.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            For functions such as <code>steam_download_scores</code>, with <code>id</code>
                            to be saved for each download request, I will use the new ENIGMA's approach for
                            that with is: <code>AssetArray</code> from <code>Universal System</code>.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And don't forget of course the minor tasks for the documentation:
                    <ul>
                        <li>CPP source files need to be documented.</li>
                        <li>Check the license for committing DLLs and headers.</li>
                        <li>Check Steamworks's official example comments.</li>
                        <li>Check GMS Manual for documenting user function's layer.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another special TODO:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Check Robert's PR <a href="https://github.com/enigma-dev/enigma-dev/pull/2349">#2349</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>Fixing Steam.exe as it's not showing up and this going to make me crazy.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Issues solved:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Implementing ENIGMA's new thread-safe <code>Async System</code> (as the old
                            one is not thread safe).</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
