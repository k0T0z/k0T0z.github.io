                        I actually decided to join Google Summer of Code 2022 program after reading about it in
                        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/cseknowledgeexchange">CSE Knowledge Exchange</a>
                        Facebook group. I started with this

                        other posts like recursion, you need a whole day to read all of them &#x1F923;. I found these
                        two posts - or 100 posts &#x1F603; - very useful as they contain also some accepted proposal

                        I started gathering all organizations that I am interested in such as ENIGMA, Dart, Blender,
                        etc. Actually, I started prioritizing the organizations based on my interest, the difficulty of
                        the project, and their community platform, as I prefer for example Discord over IRC.

                        I joined the Discord server of ENIGMA on 09/03/2022 after deciding that I will work with ENIGMA.
                        I started with building the software as recommended by mentor

                            to get ENIGMA set up on your machine you can pick your OS on the download page, here:

                        I first tried to build the software on my Windows machine using <code>make</code> but it failed.
                        Actually, I was nearly unconscious (joking &#x1F605;). In
                        <a href="https://enigma-dev.org/docs/Wiki/Install:Windows">step 4</a> of the installation
                        guide, it says: add this code snippet to bla bla bla location, and I modified it, which took a
                        lot of time for the mentors to figure out my mistake, which is I should only modify the java
                        version in the code snippet. Thanks god my mentors know what they are doing &#x1F606;.

                        I thought I am now done with the setup, but... I tried to launch
                        <a href="https://github.com/IsmAvatar/LateralGM">LGM</a> but it failed to launch, that is
                        because <code>make</code> didn't complete successfully. I wasn't aware of what is
                        <code>make</code>, actually, I wasn't aware of anything. The mentor doesn't want to repeat
                        conversations and assumed that I can understand developers' conversations &#x1F606; and said

                            the previous discussions these are the steps which I followed to run make without errors in
                            windows:
                        <ul>

                                in msys run:
                                pkg-config --cflags --libs grpc++
                            </li>
                            <li>copy its output</li>
                            <li>
                                go to enigma-dev/CommandLine/emake/Makefile
                                search for -lgrpc++ and replace it with the copied text

                            @Saif <code>advapi32</code> is missing a <code>-l</code> before it, like fundies mentioned
                            see if adding that fixes it if it doesn't, try make clean before running make again
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            oh, and there are actually two makefiles that list -lgrpc++
                            both emake and libprotocols; make sure you hit both

                        I tried that solution but again failed but now I can move forward with my own. I found another
                        <code>Makefile</code> file that also needs hard coding. I hard-coded it and it again failed. I
                        sent the error message again and Josh replied

                            looks as though <code>dbghelp</code> is also missing an <code>-l</code>

                            "missing separator" is a make syntax error; I didn't see it in the changes you posted, but
                            I'd suggest running a diff and checking over your local changes

                    <p>
                        I tried those changes and it worked. I have now understood the first
                        <code>trivial &#x1F605;</code> concept of all time, which is
                        <code>what is meant by a separator in Makefile files</code>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The solution in detail was
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Open MSYSx64 or whatever you use and type <code>pkg-config --cflags --libs grpc++</code>
                            and hit enter
                        </li>
                        <li>Copy its output to an editor like visual studio code and search for a missing separator,
                            a missing separator is <code>-l</code> before every dependency so for example
                            <code>-labsl_strings_internal advapi32 -labsl_base</code> the <code>advapi32</code> must be
                            <code>-ladvapi32</code>. Do that for all the text, search for something like this
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            After you fix all the text, open these two files
                            <code>/enigma-dev/CommandLine/emake/Makefile</code> and
                            <code>/enigma-dev/shared/protos/Makefile</code> in your visual studio code
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Search in these two makefiles for <code>-lgrpc++</code> and replace it with your fixed text
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Make sure that there are no new lines in the fixed text and also every two dependencies
                            must be separated by space for example this is correct -labsl_strings_internal -ladvapi32,
                            this is incorrect -labsl_strings_internal-ladvapi32
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                        Life is great and everything is going well. I picked

                        project to work on. Josh replied and thanks to him actually

                        So I decided to work on ENIGMA's build system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That generally was my start with ENIGMA in GSoC 2022. The next conversations are very technical
                        and related to <code>Make</code> and <code>CMake</code> build systems. Dhruv and Kartik
                        continued to help me along the road. I submitted the first version of my proposal on 09/04/2022.
                        I found out later that only 4 applicants were applying to ENIGMA in GSoC 2022. Me, Dhruv,
                        Kartik, and Nilan. I received my first review on 10/04/2022.

                        for ENIGMA on 12/04/2022, it was a trivial one that cleans up some dead files.

                        fundies mentioned something interesting related to working outside Google Summer of Code for
                        college credit. I talked to my professors and they agreed to give me credit for working on
                        my project but that's only AFTER organizing the project with my mentors. It was too late at
                        that moment anyway.

                            well if anyone doesn't get selected and doesnt mind working w/o the stipend, we can try to
                            work with your colleges to structure it as an internship for credit
                            I worked on things here for college credit when I was in school
