                        I had to discuss with my mentors about the problem of assigning a cookie to a callback function.
                        I want to do this basically because I need to assign an id for every callback I create. He said
                        that this is normal and used very often just like web cookies. The problem is I looked carefully
                        on Steamworks API and I didn't find any lamda that I can pass or something.

                        Robert said that instead of passing a function like we are doing above (see the blue part), try
                        to pass a lambda function or find out how Steamworks handle that. The Steamworks API is too huge
                        to follow by the way. Even though I found nothing related to "attach a payload to the callback".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I came up with a very trivial solution for this problem which is to prevent any furthur
                        callbacks as long as we have a running callback. Robert said that then why we have a queue in
                        the new Async system? Now that is the a real problem. The thing is If I will have multiple
                        callbacks running at the same time, then we may have a race condition. Every callback created
                        will have to access the queue for pushing a new Async map which means we may have a read/write
                        at the same time. I don't understand how ENIGMA is single-threaded yet but I think the upcoming
                        stuff will explain it.

                            is it a problem to prevent any more requests while we are processing one?

                        I was thinking about a solution every day. Even outside home. A theoritical idea came to my mind
                        and I went very quick trying to apply it. The idea is bascially about instantiating a new object
                        for every callback we create. This object will have a unique id assigned to it at the creation
                        time. When the callback is done, we will have a unique id for the callback to use. Now we have
                        2 problems:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            We need to build a system to flush the callback objects after the callbacks are done.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We need to protect the queue from any double writes at the same time as well as reading
                            while writing.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="c++">
    void c_leaderboards_score_uploaded_cookies::set_call_result(SteamAPICall_t steam_api_call) {
        c_leaderboards_score_uploaded_cookies::m_SteamCallResultUploadScore.Set(
            steam_api_call, this, &c_leaderboards_score_uploaded_cookies::on_upload_score);
    }
                        </code></pre>
                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        At the moment of instantiation, we will set the callback result as above inside the
                        constructor. This way, we only have to instantiate the object and pass the unique id.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My idea is working great but we will have to look into protecting every critical section
                        outthere.

                        Patch <a href="https://github.com/enigma-dev/enigma-dev/pull/2335">#2335</a> has some
                        problems. I found out that for the short JSON <code>[ [ 1 , 2 ] , 2 ]</code>, there are two
                        different outputs. The first one is
                        <code>{ " 0 " : { " 0 " : 1 , " 1 " : 2 } , " 1 " : 2 }</code> and the second one is
                        <code>[ { " 0 " : 1 , " 1 " : 2 } , 2 ]</code>. Both are valid JSONs so I think I need to look
                        into that PR again.

                    <h2>Starting with <code>Social</code> API</h2>
                    <p>
                        This is the worst working period in the whole summer. The Social API needs the buffer work from
                        <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2022/projects/BrXiUNA2">
                            Google Summer of Code 2022 project: Data Buffers / Serialization
                        </a>. These buffer functions are not merged into master but <code>AST-Generation</code> branch.
                        Moreover, the demo game I worked on is not working anymore because that
                        <code>AST-Generation</code> branch contains a total rewrite of the compiler. I created a new,
                        special, and simple demo game for the Social API under <code>AST-Generation</code> branch. Also,
                        LGM - the IDE for ENIGMA - needs to build every time I switch branches. The thing is that the
                        build time is very long. So every time I need to test something on master, I switch and run:
                        <code>make clean</code> and then <code>make</code>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The deployment process needs to be done as the final evaluation is coming. I will skip some
                        functions in the Social API and I can finish them later.
